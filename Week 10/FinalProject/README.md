## Description: 
### This is a website where anyone around the world can come and learn for FREE any skill which excites them. They can learn their desired skill and gain knowledge on varied subjects. A comment section is provided for the students for discussion on a particular post. The course material can be in 'written form' and in 'video form' for better understanding because people tend to remember more when they visualize it. There is a profile page, where students can easily view all their enrolled courses and if they face any problem then they can connect with myPassion customer service representative. For security purposes our user has to login first to enroll in a course and for maintaining good and healthy environment in the comment section, the Admin has the right to delete a user account if found guilty of using abusive language by the user. The myPassion team can add new courses from anywhere in the world.
